## Quotes & Comments

> In reality, the idea [functional programming (FP) in ruby] is simple, and it boils down to three key points:
>
> - Stop relying on mutable state
> - Separate data from behavior
> - Embrace #call as the primary interface for most objects,
>   where everything is designed as a data pipeline: data-in, data-out, that's it.
